"""Who can see what.

A project is visible to its owner and its members. A board is visible to its
owner and to members of any project linked to it, so adding someone to a
project also shares that project's board.

Membership checks use subqueries rather than joins so they never duplicate
rows, which would inflate the Count() annotations the list views use.
